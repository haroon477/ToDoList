My First iOS App for COMP 225

I used the iOS developer library to make my first app. I did the tutorial tutorial (twice) to understand how iOS 
development works. My App is a To-Do list. In the to-do list there are tasks that can be checked off when the task is
completed. A new task can be added by using the add symbol. I tried playing around with the GUI features of the app and 
found that Xcode is very user friendly. I understood the basics of objective C and how different classes were controlling 
different features of my App but I realize there is still work to be done. However I did learn a lot by doing the tutorial
twice but am planning to do some more tutorials off of youtube to increase by objective C understanding.
